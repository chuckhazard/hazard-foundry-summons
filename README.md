# Hazard Foundry Summons

This is a fork of the excellent FVTT module [Foundry Summons](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/MrVauxs/foundry-summons) by MrVauxs. 

For my own efforts I found it necessary to make changes for features not (yet) supported in Foundry Summons proper. Unless you specifically need this implementation, I recommend using the original project instead.

### Features

The primary purpose of this fork is to open the summon menu with a parameter list defining the columns of data that will be displayed with the creatures. These fields must be available in the index.

See [](doc/customization.md) for details.
